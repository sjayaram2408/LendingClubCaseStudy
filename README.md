## General Information
I have tried to use EDA to analyze the lending club data to understand how different variables would influence the loan status of the customer and how we can determine the possibility of the customer defaulting before hand and hence reduce the risk. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We have seen hat there are certain clear variables that call out the possibility of the customer defaulting on the loans 
- customers with higher interest are more likely to default 
- similarly customers with higher debt to income ratio are likely to default 
- we can also see that the default rate hardly varies across different purposes at lower interest rate than a high interest rate.
